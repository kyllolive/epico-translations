Help us improve Epico by translating website texts!

Epico currently supports localization for 11 languages. Only 4 (ceb, en, fil, ja) out of the 11 supported languages are manually translated while the rest are machine generated. 
The goal is to give users a tailored experience when navigating our pages by giving them accurately translated website texts. Here you may update or create the translations!
